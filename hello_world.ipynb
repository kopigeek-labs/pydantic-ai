      "Elon Musk, born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, is a prominent entrepreneur and business magnate known for his influential role in multiple high-tech companies. He was born to a Canadian mother, Maye Musk, and a South African-born British father, Errol Musk. From a young age, Elon displayed a fascination with technology and entrepreneurship, coding a computer game at the age of 12. He moved to the United States to study applied physics and later dropped out of a PhD program at Stanford after just two days to pursue his entrepreneurial interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk's career began with the creation of Zip2, a company he founded with his brother that provided online business directories. His big break came when he co-founded X.com, which eventually became PayPal after a merger. After selling PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002, Musk founded SpaceX with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. He also became CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., where he has been pivotal in transforming the automobile industry by accelerating the world’s transition to electric vehicles. Other ventures include SolarCity, which focuses on renewable energy solutions, The Boring Company for infrastructure contracts, Neuralink for developing brain-machine interfaces, and xAI, aimed at advancing artificial intelligence safety.\n",

      "In his personal life, Musk has been married three times and has ten children.
